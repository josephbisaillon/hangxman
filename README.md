Hangxman
========

Here is my glorious X-men themed twist on the traditional Hangman. Some considerations:

1. To get started, fire up your local server and point to the `www` directory.
2. After each game, the following data points are stored in the game history: `victory (boolean)`, `totalGuessCount`, `failedGuessCount`, `matchedLetters (array of indices)`, `character (object)`.
3. Even when you lose, Wolverine doesn’t die. Because you can’t kill Wolverine.

Enjoy!
